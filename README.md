# Manage GitHub organization profile

You can share information about how to engage with your organization by creating an organization profile README for
both public users and members of the organization. GitHub shows your organization profile README in the "Overview" tab
of your organization.

You can choose what information to include in your organization profile README. Here are some examples of information
that may be helpful.

* An "About" section that describes your organization
* Guidance for getting help in the organization
